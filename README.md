# Procedurally Generated Family Tree API

Since I am a genealogist in my free time, I thought a fun side-project would to be see if I can have a system that creates procedurally-generated family trees.

This is an API using the main [Procedural Family Tree class](https://github.com/brianjz/ProceduralFamilyTree). It can currently return either a person or a family unit up to 5 generations. 

There is a [public version](https://proceduralfamilytree20230629152424.azurewebsites.net/index.html) available on Azure.

# TO DO
- Allow more customization in endpoints
