# Procedurally Generated FamilyTree

Since I am a genealogist in my free time, I thought a fun side-project would to be see if I can have a system that creates procedurally-generated family trees.

This may be useful in another setting or game in the future.

Currently, it exists as a basic API to get either a person or a family unit. It is capable of building out generation after generation, but the API endpoints are not yet implemented.

# TO DO
- Add generational endpoint
- Allow more customization in endpoints
